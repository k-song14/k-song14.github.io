## Introduction

**Hello everyone!**

In today's post, we will be learning how to make an interesting data visualization using the Palmer's penguins dataset. For our visualization, we'll be making side-by-side histograms that compare the amount of male and female penguins on each island by species.

Let's begin by importing the data.

## Importing data

We'll begin by importing the package pandas, and using that to import our data from a url. 

```python
#import necessary packages
import pandas as pd

#url for dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"

#read csv file into Jupyter
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)\

#check dimensions of dataset
penguins.shape
```




    (344, 17)

## Cleaning our Variable

Next, since we'll be using this variable in our visualiation, we'll be cleaning up the "Sex" variable by getting rid of the row that has "." as its Sex. We check to make sure our code was run successfully by checking the dimensions of the dataset using .shape(). We can see that one row has been removed (originally 344, now down to 343).

```python
#gets rid of row where Sex is .
penguins = penguins[-(penguins["Sex"] == ".")]

#check dimensions of dataset to make sure code worked
penguins.shape
```




    (343, 17)

## Creating the plot

We'll now begin to create our plot. We begin by importing the package seaborn sns. Using seaborn's .catplot, we'll be creating the histograms. We set the x axis to our variable "Sex," the hue to "Species," and the color (col) to "Island." This way, we will get 3 different histograms, one for each island. Within each histogram, there will be bar(s) for males and bar(s) for females. The number of bars is determined by the number of unique species on each island, which will be color coded (blue for Adelie, orange for Chinstrap, green for Gentoo)

```python
#import necessary package
import seaborn as sns

penguin_plot = sns.catplot(x="Sex", #x variable is sex of penguin
                           hue="Species", #color of bars vary based on species
                           col="Island", #each graph is different island
                           kind = "count", #counts up number of penguins who fit specified description
                           data=penguins, 
                           height=5, 
                           aspect=.9)

```

After this step, we're done! We've officially created an interesting data visualization using the Palmer's penguins dataset! This plot can be used to determine whether the Sex variable is significant in predicting the species of penguin, which species makes up the majority on each island, etc. 
 
I hope you learned something useful from this post and thank you so much for reading!
