# Make function to clean data


```python
def make_dataset(df):
  # Remove stopwords from the article text and title. 
  # A stopword is a word that is usually considered to be uninformative, such as “the,” “and,” or “but.” 
  # Construct and return a tf.data.Dataset with two inputs and one output. The input should be of the form (title, text), 
  # and the output should consist only of the fake column. You may find it helpful to consult lecture notes or this tutorial for 
  # reference on how to construct and use Datasets with multiple inputs

  #stop words
  stop = stopwords.words('english')

  #remove stop words from article title
  df["title"] = df['title'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
  #remove stop words from article text
  df["text"] = df['text'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop)]))

  data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
   ( # dictionary for input data/features
    #our two inputs: title and text
    { "title": df[["title"]],
     "text": df["text"]
    },
    # dictionary for output data/labels
    # one output: fake
    { "fake": df[["fake"]]
        
    }   
   ) 
  ) 

  return data.batch(100)

```


```python
#batch our data to make training faster; train on chunks of data rather than individual rows
data = make_dataset(train_data)
```


```python
#check size of dataset
len(data)
```




    225



# Split data into training and validation sets


```python
#shuffle dataset
data = data.shuffle(buffer_size = len(data))

#20% validation
val_size  = int(0.2*len(data))

val = data.take(val_size)
train = data.skip(val_size).take(len(data) - val_size)

#check size of training and validation sets
print(len(train), len(val))
```

    180 45


# Base rate - Labels Iterator, fake text, count of labels, on training data


```python
# Base rate 
## similar to previous hw; can get true and fake from training data, labels iterator on fake column

labels_iterator= train.unbatch().map(lambda input, output: output).as_numpy_iterator()

train_data2 = train_data.sample(n=1800)

len(train_data2[train_data2["fake"] == 1]) / 1800
```




    0.5211111111111111



The base rate appears to be about 52%, which indicates that a little more than half of the artiles in the training data is fake while the other half is true.

# Model Creation

# Text vectorization

#preparing a text vectorization layer for tf model

                                  '[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation),'')
    return no_punctuation 

## Title Vectorization

    standardize=standardization,
    max_tokens=size_vocabulary, # only consider this many words
    output_mode='int',
    output_sequence_length=500) 

title_vectorize_layer.adapt(train.map(lambda x, y: x["title"]))

## Text Vectorization

```


```python

title_features = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.2)(title_features)

Five words that I found interpretable and interesting in this visualization are "apparently," "fox," "reportedly," "radical," and "21wire," all of which reside towards the left side of the visualization. "fox" and "21wire" most likely refers to Fox News and 21st Century Wire, which are both news sources that have been criticized for spreading propoganda and false or exhaggerated information. "apparently" and "reportedly" also make sense to me because these are words that are often used by writers when they can't be sure about the information; these words allow them to detach themselves from involvement. "radical" also makes sense as a fake news word because a lot of fake news articles tend to attack "radical leftists."
