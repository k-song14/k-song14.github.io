Hello everyone! Today we will be learning how to create a simple submission page with Flask.

The repository for this activity can be accessed here: https://github.com/k-song14/16BHW5

First, make sure you have your heroku app set up and download the necessary packages.

```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request
import numpy as np
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)
```

For our page, we will have three html files and 5 different functions. Each html page corresponds to a different webpage within our webapp; base.html is our initial page with the links to our submission page (submit.html) and view messages page (view.html). We will first focus on what's in our app.py before we check out our html files.


We begin by rendering base.html for the initial page. Here is what it looks like:


<body>
    
    <h2>A Simple Message Bank</h2>
        <nav> 
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/submit/" title="submit message">Submit a message</a></li>
                <li><a href="/view/" title="view message">View messages</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

</body>


We have a link to the page where you'll be able to submit a message, and a link to the page where you can see the messages.

```python
@app.route("/") 
def base():
    return render_template("base.html")
    
 ```

Afterwards, we work on the submit page. On this page, users will be able to submit a message and their name or handle.

```python
@app.route("/submit/", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        # if the user just visits the url
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        try:
            # if the user submits the form
            message = request.form['message']
            name = request.form['name']
            # call the database function if successful submission
            return render_template(insert_message(message))
        except:
            return render_template('submit.html', error=True)
```

Here is what the submit page looks like:



<header>
    <h2>Submit</h2>
</header>

<body>
    <form method="post">
        <label for="message">Your message:</label>
        <br>
        <input name="message" id="message">
        <br>
        <label for="name">Your name or handle:</label>
        <br>
        <input name="name" id="name">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form">
        <input type="reset" value="Reset">
    </form>   
</body>

As you can see, there is an area for the user to write our a message and their name. They can either choose to submit the form or reset it. 
    
    
To successfuly be able to view the messages, you need two functions: one to open the connection and create the table, and one to access the messages.
    
get_message_db() is used to create the table, while insert_message() accesses the table to insert what the user submits into the table. It then called on random_messages to randomize our existing messages.
    
```python
    
def get_message_db():
    try:
        return g.message_db
    except:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")
        cmd = \
        '''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `messages` (
            id  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT  ,
            name TEXT NOT NULL,
            message TEXT NOT NULL
        );
        '''
        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
        cursor.execute(cmd)
        return g.message_db

def insert_message(request):
    conn = get_message_db()
    cmd = \
    '''
    INSERT INTO messages
    VALUES (name, message)
    '''

    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    
```

```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():

    #render template
    #return render_template('view.html', messages = random_messages(5))
    db = get_message_db()

    #SQL command
    messages = db.execute("SELECT * FROM messages").fetchall()
    return render_template('view.html', message=messages)

#def random_messages(n):
    # refer to insert_messages and discussion view function 
    # HINT SQL command - ORDER BY RANDOM()

    #connect database
    #db = get_message_db()

    #SQL command
    #messages = db.execute("SELECT * FROM").fetchall()
```

If you have extra time, you can play around with CSS to style the elements present on the page!
    
As I currently do not have the CSS file available, I will provide some examples of what you can do with it.

If you wanted to change the background color of just the form, you would follow the following code:
    
form {

    /*

    changes form color to difference color than background

    */

    background-color: lavender;

}
    
However, be careful! Since you're calling on form{}, every form you have will be changed to this color. If you wanted to simply change only one specific form, you would give the form a distinct id or class (ex. id='form1' or class='forms'). Within the CSS file, you would do
    
    
#form1{

    background-color: lavender;

}
    
for a form assigned id=form1, or 

.forms{

    background-color: lavender;

}
    
for a form assigned to class=forms.
    
    
To change the other elements on the page, you would follow similar steps. For example, let's take a look at the following code:

h1{

    /*

    changes our title / header to a different color than black and
    makes the size 2.5 times larger than the default and centers it

    */

    color:indigo;
    text-align:center;
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    font-size: 2.5em;
}
    
This code will change any title/header within your h1 scripts to be times new roman, aligned in the center, the color indigo, and 2.5 times larger than its default size.
    
You can also play around with audio and images, but that's beyond our scope for the time being.
